# Ace To-Do List

## üü¢ Refactor

- Make `llvm::Value*` variable names consistent
- Refer to `Self` and `self` consistently (`Self` is sometimes `SelfType`)
- Cache `Scope::CollectSymbols` or just generally cache in `Scope` for performance
- Rename `ControlFlowNode` to `ControlFlowInstruction` or something, node implies its a tree structure but really its linear
- Make diagnostics take symbols, syntaxes, etc. instead of source locations, it allows focusing on the important code in the function
- ‚ùì Eliminate local lambdas
- ‚ùì String interning
- ‚ùì Double underscore all public names that shouldnt be used: `__StrongPtr`, `__Ref`

## üî¥ High Priority

- Open source:
  - Add `README`
  - Make repository public
- Supertraits
- Remove redundant undeclared symbol error for unimplemented function: When resolving associated functions, check if the type implements a trait with a function of that name, then just 'trust' it is implemented
- Replace operators with traits
- Fix that glue doesnt bind on private types
- Dynamic casting (how to handle failed conversions?)

## üü° Medium Priority

- Make a user friendly version of `ISymbol::CreateSignature` that will be used in error messages (`ace::std::rc::StrongPtr[ace::std::Int32]` &rarr; `*i32`)
- Forbid taking reference of a r-value
- Add self type signature to member access resolution error message
- Diagnostics when redeclared type parameter
- Forbid constructing of non-pub struct
- Trait operators:
  - Change `__deref_as[T](...)` to take any type convertible to `std::Ptr` and remove `std::Ref[T]::ptr(...)`
  - Make copying into unintialized variables safe (When a unintialized variable's field is dropped, it could cause unwanted behaviour &rarr; possibly fixed by lifetime trait)
  - Lifetime trait: default, copy, drop
- Unit testing (Test that `CreateTokenKindString` handles all possible values, test `Keyword.cpp`)

- Add diagnosis for leaking private types in public interface
- Add source location to unknown files like `.cpp`
- Strings
- Control flow flexibility improvement:
  - `IEmittable` could hold `ControlFlowGraph`, so it could verify control flow
  - Possibly implement `ControlFlowNode`s for `LLVM IR` instructions (check `llvm/IR/Instruction.def`)
- Check if there is any better way to not use external programs like `llc` and `clang`
- New syntax for struct construction, the current `new Struct { ... }` and `Struct::new(...)` are too similiar
- Struct update constructor syntax
- Mutability/Immutability:
  - Mutable references have to be taken with `mut` eg.: `mutating_function(mut mutable_expression)`
- Remove duplicate module filepaths in package: `./dawg/../dawg/` is the same as `./dawg/`
- Enums

## ‚ö™ Low Priority

- Local variable assignment analysis (data flow analysis), control flow graph
- Metadata:
  - Export/import symbol metadata for reflection and headers
  - Metadata will be stored in exe/dll files this way:
    - Last 8 bytes of file will be u64 which stores value of metadata size in bytes
    - `[ ? bytes - Content of exe/dll ][ X bytes -  Metadata ][ 8 bytes - X ]`
- Dll package dependencies
- Dll calls
- Reflection
- Figure out how to share globals between dlls
- ‚ùì Remove local variable shadowing, it causes more mistakes than usefulness
- Rewrite `package.json` to `package.ace`:
  ```rs
  import std::build;

  package(): std::Package {
      ret new std::Package {
          name: "ace",
          path_macros: [
              new std::PathMacro {
                  name: "$project_path",
                  value: "/home/samo/repos/ace/ace/src/",
              },
          ],
          file_paths: [
              "$project_path/**.ace",
          ],
          dependency_file_paths: [
              "$project_path/**.dll"
          ],
      };
  }
  ```
